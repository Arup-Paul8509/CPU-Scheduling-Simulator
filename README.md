# Project Title: CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Objective: 
The objective of this project is to develop a Java-based simulator that enables users to visualize and analyse various CPU scheduling algorithms.

## Introduction:
CPU scheduling, in operating systems, determining the order of process execution by the CPU. This simulator provides an interactive platform where users can evaluate several scheduling algorithms, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin (RR) and more.

## Problem Statement
Choosing the right CPU scheduling algorithm is essential for optimizing performance in operating systems. Different algorithms have unique characteristics, and selecting the most appropriate one depends on various performance criteria, such as maximizing response time or minimizing average waiting time. The challenge is to determine the best algorithm for a specific scenario. This project addresses this challenge by allowing users to experiment with and compare the performance of different algorithms in a simulated environment.
